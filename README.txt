8.) Inject the database.sql file included in the pack to your database. Its quiet simple you click admin on APACHE on your XXAMP.
Then you create a new database eg 'qb-core', click on it to open it and click 'operations' and then select the .sql file
and press 'GO' this should inject all the required .sql so you don't have to copy and paste it from all the qb mods.
